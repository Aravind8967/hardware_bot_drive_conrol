I created a robot with 4 wheel and used L293D moor driver and arduino mega

step 1 : to control robot connect arduino to the laptop/pc

step 2 : install aruino code

step 3 : open 1st terminal write as " roscore" 

step 4 : open 2nd terminal write as " rosrun rosserial_arduino serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0 

step 5 : open 3rd terminal write as " rostopic list "  after this you can see publishing topics

step 6 : download and run python file and give command to robot by keyboard
